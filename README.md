### Welcome to Ali Hamie profile ðŸ‘‹
I am an astrophysics graduate with an experience in observational cosmology. A science that studies inaccessible astronomical objects to quantify broad existential, scientific, and philosophical questions. This particularity requires developing the most advanced state-of-the-art variety of software. In my repositories, you will find many universe sciences shareable algorithms used or developed during my research experience in laboratories or from my self-paced work and specialized courses. They include modeling and simulation, statistics and data analysis, and image processing. My works also include non-scientific programming. I am happy to share what I continuously learn and I am looking forward to relevant collaborations.
